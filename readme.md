# CS50 Coursework

This repo is a collection of my course work performed for Harvard's online "Web Programming With JavaScript and Python" course.
Each folder is a different assignment, containing the source code for the assignment,
along with a text file with the instructions for the assignment.

The course began with simple static web pages using HTML/CSS before moving on to backend applications using Python with
the Django framework. The course then covers further topics such as SQL databases, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Selenium,
regex, testing, continuous integration, scalability, and security, among others.
